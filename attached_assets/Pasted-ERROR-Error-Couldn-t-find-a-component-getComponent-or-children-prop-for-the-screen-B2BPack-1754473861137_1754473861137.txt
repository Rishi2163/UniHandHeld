 How to fix: 
  When you see Red Box with stack trace, you can click any 
  stack frame to jump to the source file. The packager will launch your 
  editor of choice. It will first look at REACT_EDITOR environment 
  variable, then at EDITOR.
  To set it up, you can add something like 
  export REACT_EDITOR=atom to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc depending on 
  which shell you use.
