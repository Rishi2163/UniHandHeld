# React Native Migration Status

## ✅ COMPLETED

### Project Structure
- ✅ Created complete React Native project using Expo SDK 51
- ✅ Set up proper package.json with compatible dependencies
- ✅ Configured Babel, Metro, and Expo app.json
- ✅ Created index.js entry point

### Screen Migration (8/8)
1. ✅ **PickingLandingScreen** - Welcome screen with navigation to picklists
2. ✅ **B2BPackingScreen** - Main picklists view with filtering, search, and barcode toggle
3. ✅ **PicklistDetailScreen** - Individual picklist with shelf listings and section dialogs
4. ✅ **ToteScannerScreen** - Camera-based tote barcode scanning
5. ✅ **ShelfDetailScreen** - Shelf information with item listings
6. ✅ **SKUScannerScreen** - Product scanning with pending/scanned tabs
7. ✅ **ShelfSelectionScreen** - Manual shelf selection (input mode)
8. ✅ **SKUInputScreen** - Manual SKU entry (input mode)

### Navigation & State
- ✅ React Navigation 6 with Stack and Bottom Tab navigators
- ✅ Type-safe navigation with proper TypeScript types
- ✅ BarcodeModeContext for global scanner/input mode state
- ✅ React Query for API state management (same as web)

### Components
- ✅ CameraCapture component with expo-camera integration
- ✅ Barcode scanning with visual overlay
- ✅ Photo capture functionality
- ✅ Camera permissions handling

### Business Logic
- ✅ All picking workflow logic preserved from web version
- ✅ Dual mode functionality (scanner vs manual input)
- ✅ Same API integration and data structures
- ✅ Matching user experience and functionality

## ⚠️ INSTALLATION REQUIRED

The mobile app is completely built but needs dependency installation:

```bash
cd mobile
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm install --legacy-peer-deps react-native-web @expo/metro-runtime
```

## 🚀 TESTING

After installing dependencies:

```bash
# Start Expo development server
cd mobile
npm start

# Test options:
# 1. Scan QR code with Expo Go app on your phone
# 2. Press 'w' for web preview
# 3. Press 'a' for Android emulator
# 4. Press 'i' for iOS simulator
```
