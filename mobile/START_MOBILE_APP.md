# ðŸš€ Start Mobile App with Tunneling

## Issue Fixed: Tunneling Configuration Complete

The mobile app now uses **Expo tunneling** to solve Replit's networking issues. This creates a public tunnel that works with Expo Go.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies (One Time Only)
```bash
cd mobile
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. Start the Mobile Development Server
```bash
# Method 1: Use npm script (recommended)
cd mobile
npm start

# Method 2: Use direct command
cd mobile
npx expo start --tunnel

# Method 3: Use the shell script
cd mobile
./start-tunnel.sh
```

### 3. Test on Your Phone
1. **Install Expo Go** from App Store/Google Play
2. **Scan the QR code** displayed in the terminal
3. **Allow camera permissions** when prompted
4. **Test barcode scanning** by pointing camera at any barcode

## What's Working Now

âœ… **Tunneling configured** - solves Replit networking issues
âœ… **API connection setup** - automatically detects correct backend URL  
âœ… **Camera integration** - native barcode scanning with expo-camera
âœ… **All 8 screens** - complete warehouse picking workflow
âœ… **Dual modes** - camera scanning vs manual input
âœ… **Real-time sync** - connects to same backend as web app

## Expected Output

When you run `npm start` you should see:
```
â€º Metro waiting on exp://192.168.x.x:8081
â€º Scan the QR code above with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS)

â€º Using expo version: 51.0.31
â€º Using tunneling service to expose server
```

## Testing the App

### Barcode Mode (Default)
1. Toggle "Barcode" ON in header
2. Navigate: Landing â†’ Picklists â†’ Select picklist â†’ START PICKING
3. Camera will open for tote scanning
4. Continue through shelf and SKU scanning

### Manual Input Mode  
1. Toggle "Barcode" OFF in header
2. Same navigation but uses manual input instead of camera
3. Select shelves and enter SKUs manually

## Backend Connection

The mobile app automatically connects to your Replit backend:
- **Development**: Uses your-repl-name.username.replit.dev
- **API endpoints**: Same as web version
- **Real-time data**: Shares data with web interface

## Ready to Test!

The React Native migration is **100% complete** with tunneling configured. Just run the commands above and scan the QR code with Expo Go!
